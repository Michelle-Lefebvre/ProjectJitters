2020/08/09 Sunday morning Scrum meeting was unplanned
Discussed: 
Admin when returning to index the session was lost and the user logged out.
Solution was to add a side navigation for the admin users to navigate site, simplify the admin menu to cards, items, orders, users. These links to go to their respective lists. All actions would be accessible in the List with the Add to be a call to action button beside the title of the form. While in any url links from the List (add|edit|delete) there will be a cancel button that will return to the list. Also the success page will return to it's list to continue.
